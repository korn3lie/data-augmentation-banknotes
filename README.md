# Data Augmentation - Banknote Images

Created for my bachelor thesis to manipulate images of banknotes.

Simple operations with OpenCV.

Scribble generation with ground truth masks, 
with some modified code taken from the [augraphy](https://github.com/sparkfish/augraphy) library.

As an example below, a scribble and the corresponding ground truth.
